# Comments:

- Developer takes too long to actually run the code.
  - You spend too much time talking about the code and not writing the code
  - in order for you to figure out the problem it starts with you actually seeing what doesn't work instead of assuming it isn't or that it does
  - errors shouldn't freak you out.
- psudo code
