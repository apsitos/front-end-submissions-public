#### Project Name:
Nourish
#### Client:
People who want to pursue happiness and a more balanced life by concentrating on a daily practice of four things. Physical health, emotional health, mental health, and spiritual health. (Me)
### Deliverables:

#### Project Pitch
We often get caught up in the latest fitness trends and fads. We try and count calories or drink more water, push ourselves to the limit and ignore what truly impacts our health and happiness. Nourish is an app for wellness. There are four types of wellness and health- physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. In this application, I am creating a habit-forming tracker to track these four categories in your busy, everyday lives. When you complete tasks, you will be celebrated for your achievements. Nourish is a positive, happy, and inspiring app for those wanting to change the way they live.

### Wireframes
    - Include screenshots to wireframes of EVERY PAGE of the MVP of your app

#### Frameworks
React, React Router, Redux, SCSS

#### APIs
No APIs, just some really clean, well-tested code and awesome UX/UI

#### MVP
Exactly what my wireframes look like, that is the very least that I need.

#### RVP
I would love for this app to be fully working, something I could put out to the world and let people use. I want to be able to use this app and be excited to log with it every day. I want there to be colorful graphs and animations congratulating the users on their achievements. Places to log their achievements and just an overall happy and exciting experience. 

#### Collaborators
Me, Brittany was super helpful in our first talk and I will be keeping in touch with her.
