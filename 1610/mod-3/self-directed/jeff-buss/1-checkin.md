#### Project Pitch
Organizing private dinner parties is a pain in the ass. You probably have the location locked down, a team of capable chefs, and all the equipment you need. Organizing your guests and receiving payment prior to the event is the hard part. 

The goal of this app is to create a singular portal for private, event-specific sign-up using an invitation code, details on the event, RSVP form to submit the details for your party, and a payment processing system to get the funds required in advance.

#### Frameworks

Not using any frameworks, but will be utilizing:

* React/Redux/Router
* Firebase
* MaterialUI
* Sass

#### APIs

I'll be using firebase as my API. Integrating a payment system (likely Square) and Google Maps will be my first step once I get the basics completed. After that I'd like to look into Mailchimp and Twilio for establishing contact lists.

#### MVP
* Login page w/ event-specific invite code that will link user to that event.
* Event page w/ all the relevant info (pics, chef/crew name, location, date, time, menu, etc
* Event creation page which will only be available to authorized users

#### RVP

Time-permitting, I'd like to dive into:

* Google calendar integration
* Google maps API
* Payment processor (likely Square)
* Twilio/Mailchimp

#### Collaborators
* Me
* Myself
* Dan Grund will tell me if stuff sucks
