#### Check In: 1

#### Project Name: Community Connections

#### Client: American Seniors and College Students

### Deliverables:

#### Project Pitch
    - My app matches seniors with spare rooms and students that need housing, based on the time available each could spend with the other and shared interests.  It's inspired by the HUMANITAS house in the Netherlands, where students stay at the nursing home rent-free, in exchange for 30 hours of service with the residents.  Such programs or matches could not only help ease the social isolation that can come with aging and the financial burden of higher education, but help break down age-segregation in society.  

### Wireframes
    - Screenshots to every page of the mvp are included.  I'm struggling with the right color choices, so the different colors you see on each page aren't intentional and I will have a unified design once I figure out what I both like, and is AAA accessible.

#### Frameworks
    - React, Redux, React Router, and firebase if there's time.

#### APIs
    - I will not be using an API...

#### MVP
    - Minimum Viable Product: I can guarantee a stellar, 100% accessible form for seniors by the end of two weeks.

#### RVP
    - Reach Viable Product: In a perfect, world, if you get EVERYTHING done, what does that look like? What are the dream extensions you want to build?

    The users are matched based on a weighted data form with cool micro-transitions I haven't even thought of yet...  Users can sign in with firebase.  Users can message each other on the app.  The design, while different for seniors and for students, is unified.

#### Collaborators
    - Just me
