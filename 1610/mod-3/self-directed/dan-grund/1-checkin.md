Deliverables:

Project Pitch
At GrooveBox we give you the ingredients you need to build vibey grooves and ride tasty waves. At it's simplest, GrooveBox is a 
single page react-based website that loads a step-sequencer drum machine that allows you to build a beat. when you have a beat 
you're into, you can toggle over to the canvas visualizer, which also happens to feature a hidden playable keyboard.

Frameworks

It's going to be built with react, and the p5.js library for both visuals and sound management. 

MVP

working drum sequencer that toggles shapes on the canvas. shapes may be really minimal. keyboard playable on visualizer screen. 

- Reach Viable Product: 

viable product would take advantage of all of the p5.js sound nodes to allow for greater synthesis of each sound, along with more complex visuals
