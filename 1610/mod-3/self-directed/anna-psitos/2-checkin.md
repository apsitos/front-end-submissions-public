### Student: Anna P

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Name: Find a Restaurant

#### Client:

### Deliverables:  

##### Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).  
  - React
  - Google Places API

##### Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.  
  - I've hit the API and started to build a framework for the app. I still need to actually go through my array, get a random result displayed, and figure out how to make a circle spin. I have to hardcode the lat and long for the API search because I do not know how to either have the website check for geolocation or to get the geolocation API and transfer that data dynamically to the places API.

##### The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.  
  - I'm hopeful that I can randomly select a restaurant from the array I receive from the API and display it on the screen. I hope to also have my wireframes fully built out and be implementing at least some of it.

##### What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?
  - I would love to figure out how to allow the user to change their location, but at this point I need to move forward.

### Screen Shots of Current State Of App  
  - I will add screenshots on GitHub.
