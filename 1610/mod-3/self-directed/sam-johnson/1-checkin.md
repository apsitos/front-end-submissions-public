### Student: Sam Johnson

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Name: SchoolFinder

#### Client: Denver pre-K through 12 parents

### Deliverables: A single-page web application

#### Project Pitch
    - Shark Tank Style. Sell me on what your app does and why its important.

### Wireframes
    - My application will be a single page map application with a basic login entry point for tracking specific history/data about the user.
    - Rough wireframe is here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCPuZJsLvsbpurwUaMJ21uYIVRutiTvpeeSv9EpaCi4/edit?usp=sharing

#### Frameworks
    - React / Redux / Sass / Firebase

#### APIs
    - I will be using the Google Maps Directions API as the base of my app - for both the map display, directions data and specific location-based date available from Google.
    - Because the school-based data I am using will require some work to scrub off of the internet, I am planning, as an MVP, to build out a very basic database in Firebase as a proof of concept and then will continue to build it out - ideally with the help of a backend person - in Mod4.

#### MVP
    - Google Map Directions API setup
    - Basic filtering
    - Basic backend built in Firebase for demoing concept and basic functionality
    - Basic information about commute displayed on map
    - Pop-up for each school displayed

#### RVP
  I think the above is going to be more than enough for the 9 days I have to build this application.  That said, here are a few other advanced features I'd like to try to build out.  They are listed in order or priority.
    - Links to school
    - Advanced filters
    - Search for specific schools
    - 2nd location (e.g. work) - for chaining total trip time/distance w/ school in the middle

#### Collaborators
  So far, I have gotten advice/guidance/thought partnering from:
    - Keji Amos (1701 FE)
    - Brittany Storoz
