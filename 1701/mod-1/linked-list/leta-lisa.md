### Functional Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
