### Progression/Completion

Notes:

Recommend to continue working on this while pairing.

Window management - so you can have the tests below the code and pull up the docs really quickly.

I'm pushing you to go in uncomfortable directions with the code - in a work flow that isn't the one you typically like to take.

* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Testing

Notes: need to be pushed to do the testing first.

Feel free to have the testing docs up to remind self of the different expectations available.

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
