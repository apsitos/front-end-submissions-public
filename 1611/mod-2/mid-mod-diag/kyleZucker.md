Pay attention to criteria in the test examples - look out for hidden functionality :D

Tests can be in the same window to save you from having to pop between windows. Will also allow you to reference the error with less mental weight - you tend to hop back and forth quickly. 

Great job responding to throwing in challenges! Consider refactoring down the sort function - could you make it smaller now that you understand what's going on?
