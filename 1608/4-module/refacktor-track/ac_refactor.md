##Work Completed

I used this past week to primarily focus on my job hunt. I had put in a lot of time at the end of Mod3 and during break to establish some solid leads, but I’d hardly spent any time during the first two weeks of Mod4 looking for jobs. Job hunting has been very stressful - I’m looking forward to getting my first job as a dev so that I can breathe a little bit more. 

When I wasn’t job hunting, I worked on Movie Keeper and Real Time. At the beginning of Refactor, Movie Keeper would not even run locally. I was able to fix this by deleting node modules and preventing an auto update to React Router 4. After being able to work locally I worked to remove the React Bootstrap from my code that I had been using for my modals; additionally, I updated the styles revolving around these modals. I had some of my proudest PRs as a dev refactoring last week.

Concerning Real Time, I worked to refactor some of my code that allowed a user to vote prior to signing into the poll. I also noticed that part of my poor workflow score was due to the fact that I was cleaning my repos and created a separate repo that removed all my pull requests prior to the project being graded.

##Meeting Summaries
			
I met with Nathanial initially to set project goals for Movie Keeper. He outlined with me the following: 

1: When cloning down the repo, the developer is not able to launch the application locally. There is a bug that prevents this from doing so that I need to work out - React Router 4 issue?
2: Currently, it is not deployed to production. 
3: In addition to figuring out this bug I want 
to write some solid tests for the application. 
4: update search using $.get().abort()
5: make more responsive
6: Expand Readme.md with more lessons learned. 
- working with api
- dealing with nested data
- making multiple api requests 
- css/responsive design

I still have a few items to complete for this, most importantly my testing, deploying to production, and finish updating my README.

I also met with Bree to discuss options concerning modal transitions. We discussed a few options then decided that it was more of a tertiary goal as compared to updating the responsiveness of the app.

##Experience logging hours

Considering I come from project management, you’d think I’d be good at logging my minutes, however, I was awful at it this week and usually reverted to manually entering my time after the fact. 85% of my logged hours are conservative estimates of the time I spent during the week.

##Discuss: experience doing stand ups

I enjoyed doing the daily stand ups. Daily stand ups were a part of our dev team where I previously worked, but I had never participated in one. I found that, though we were all working individually, we were able to pull together and feel more a part of a team than simply working alone. The stand ups also allowed me to be accountable with the work I had done, or had not done but needed to do.

##Discuss: one negative to this style of project

The only negative aspect of this style of project is that we didn’t do this with our previous individual projects. I really appreciated the accountability that comes from the self-direction and accountability from meeting every day.

##Something I didn’t know at the beginning of the week

I did not understand how modals work. I wouldn’t say that I understand how they work now, only that I know how they work in the way that I made mine. I’m excited about learning different, potentially more performative ways of creating modals.

### Notes:

Make sure you change your gist file names to the correct file type - like .md for markdown. Makes it way earlier to read cause you don't get the infinite scroll.

What does the 'job search' mean for you when you write it down as a line item for a day? Only asking because it can be high yeild activities like going out into the world, meeting people - or low yeild activities - like Steve's example of sitting in your apartment, in the dark, under a blanket drinking boxed wine and skimming Linkedin. I am sure this is already a skill set you have, but please feel free to schedule time with Jeff, Meg, Me, Brittany, Alex, anyone if you just want to talk through it :D
