### Summarize the meetings or pairing sessions you completed this week
  - I met with Meeka and Bree at the beginning of the week to discuss goals for the project. Meeka gave me good advice on what I should focus on and how to prioritize my time for the week. Bree looked over my personal project, gave me a few things I should focus on with UI/UX, and provided some resources that would help with that.
  - I did a Google hangout with Justin Lewis, who works at TerraFrame. I am really interested in this company because they do a lot of GIS work, and also have a team dedicated to doing international development work. It was really interested hearing about Justin's background, and he told me about some meetups and nonprofits that I haven't heard of before and will definitely look into. At this time they are not hiring, but might in the near future.
  - I had coffee with Sharon Marchand, who works at Summit XD. It was helpful to hear about how she got to where she is today, and how she finds ways to teach herself new languages.

### Summarize your experience logging hours this week. 
Logging hours this week really helped me stay motivated and see where my time was going. I think it helped me prioritize my time and ensured I was devoting enough time to each area in order to meet my goals. It is something I plan to continue.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I enjoyed doing daily stand ups. It helped me keep track of what I was doing, kept me accountable for staying on top of my goals, and it was good to check in with everyone else and see how they were doing. There was one day when I was working remotely and just posted in the channel, but I felt like I was missing out since there wasn't any kind of response or summary from the people who were at school.

### Discuss: one negative to this style of project

I think with this type of project it is easy to underestimate how much time everything will take. I feel like I worked really hard this week and got a lot done, but I also did not get to everything I hoped to.  

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I got to play around in Mapbox, which was really cool! I created different map layers, with points that you can click on and have a popup with information you input come up. I then was able to figure out how to disable scroll zoom, and put in a zoom bar and different things like that. I have a background in GIS, but this is the first time I've really done much with mapping like this, so it was fun!
