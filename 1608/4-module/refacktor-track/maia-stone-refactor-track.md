##Summarize the work you completed over the last week
Over the last week my priorities were to work on Real Time, my personal site, and my personal project. In addition, I pursued several opportunites on the job front, and spent time with my family. Real Time was my biggest letdown. I would have had to dedicate way more hours to fix the bug, and for a variety of reasons, I chose to direct my resources towards other goals. I'm happy with the progress on my personal project. I'm waiting for more content from my client, otherwise, things are in good shape to deploy soon. I felt confident enough with my personal site to send it out, but in hindsight, given more time, I would put more into individual project pages. I'm continually not quite happy with design, so I'd also like to work with a designer, maybe reach out to some personal contacts, to get some feedback and suggestions to improve my design choices. However, at this point, I'm not sure if that's something that will actually benefit me in the job search, or something I might continue for personal development, and potential jobs and connections in the future.

##Summarize the meetings or pairing sessions you completed this week
I met with Bree and Jeff this week. Both meetings reinforced the direction I'd like to see my career take, and left me feeling more confident and excited. I'm now focusing on the agency road, with the exception of some particular product companies I would enjoy. Bree was able to immediately connect me with a couple of people/companies.  One of them already got back to me, deciding they need a senior, and the other, I'm meeting with on Monday. Bree also gave me some great feedback on my personal site, which I was able to implement immediately.    

Jeff was encouraging and listened to my feedback that the program doesn't allow for a focus on this type of work, as it's preparing us more for larger enterprises or more highly technical, rather than creative/visual work.  After these meetings and deciding on a capstone project, I'm really looking forward to finishing out the mod, and to a more focused job search.

##Summarize your experience logging hours this week.

In an intersting turn of events, I enjoyed logging my hours. I remember working in public accounting, and not being a fan of billable hours. When I moved to corporate tax, I felt somewhat relieved of not having to do this, while at the same time, being shocked at the time my coworkers would spend being 'unproductive' or 'non-billable'. I like having a grasp on how I actually spend my time, and how productive I am throughout the day. It's nice to know what's eating up my time, and I found myself working with a bit more urgency.

##Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I really enjoy hearing what everyone is working on, and it made me both more confident in what I chose to do with my time, but also realize and question my choices.  I think I could have done more, or focused more, but I'm happy with the outcomes of the week.  I would enjoy standup in the workplace, when everyone is sharing what they are doing to contribute to the whole.  In this case, everyone was working towards their own goals, so I did find myself zoning out sometimes.  Overall, I'm glad we could all share our experiences and hold each other accountable.

##Discuss: one negative to this style of project
The only thing I can think of is that it would have been nice to have the project specs earlier, so we could really think about what was important during the week.  There was more flexibility than I imagined, and it would have been nice to have more time to plan and more time to talk through options with an instructor.   Otherwise, I can't think of anything negative. It was JUST what I needed this week.

##Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
Now that I've really honed in the agency track, I could actually do a search for agencies in Denver and reach out for specific help making direct connections.  Since before starting Turing, I wanted to know 'exactly' what I wanted to do when I would finish, but finally discovering it with 3 weeks left. I also learned quite a bit more about WordPress, and it seems likely I could end up on that platform, so I intend to do more leveling up on that skill.

# Instructor Feedback

Completed by Meeka: Feb 13, 2017

### Were all the boxes checked?

- [x] Documentation of experience completed
- [x] All major work was completed in PRs
- [x] An attempt at logging hours was completed
- [x] All standups were attended or updates were posted in the channel
- [x] Student met up with someone or refactored with someone

### Notes:

On the documentation of the work - if you change the file type to markdown, it'll make things easier to read (I always forget this step the first time around!)

I really appreciate the time you took putting together the documentation. It was really cool to read about your experience for the week, and I think as instructors it's probably really valuable for us to read things like this so that we continue to have empathy for and a better understanding of what the student side of the experience is like.

It was really fun to get to meet Jaime and hang out Friday night! And I'm _very_ excited for the Capstone project. Glad that we can get Lauren as a resource to work with you and find the part of the programming world that gets you excited.
